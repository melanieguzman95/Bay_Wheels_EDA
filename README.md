### 📈 Key Insights  

1. **Station Usage**:  
   - High-performing stations are concentrated in **downtown San Francisco** near commuter hubs and tourist areas (e.g., Financial District, Embarcadero).  

2. **Seasonal Trends**:  
   - Ridership peaks in **summer (July)** and **fall (October)** and dips in **winter (January)**.  

3. **User Behavior**:  
   - **Weekdays**: Members dominate usage during peak commute hours (7–9 AM, 5–6 PM).  
   - **Weekends**: Casual riders lead, primarily for leisure at recreational hotspots.  

4. **Bike Preferences**:
