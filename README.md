# Bay Wheels Bike-Share Data Analysis

This project examines Bay Wheels bike-share data to understand usage patterns, identify popular stations, and analyze user behavior across casual riders and members. It includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: All preprocessing was conducted in Python, including cleaning, integrating, and transforming monthly trip data.  
- **Data Analysis**: Evaluating seasonal trends, station popularity, ride duration, and user preferences.  
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards were created in Tableau to effectively present the findings.  
- **Presentation**: Results and key insights are summarized in a PDF presentation, which can be found in the `presentation` folder.  
- **Data Source**: The data used for this analysis can be downloaded from the Bay Wheels website: [Bay Wheels Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html).

### 📈 Key Insights  

1. **Station Usage**:  
   - High-performing stations are concentrated in **downtown San Francisco** near commuter hubs and tourist areas (e.g., Financial District, Embarcadero).  

2. **Seasonal Trends**:  
   - Ridership peaks in **summer (July)** and **fall (October)** and dips in **winter (January)**.  

3. **User Behavior**:  
   - **Weekdays**: Members dominate usage during peak commute hours (7–9 AM, 5–6 PM).  
   - **Weekends**: Casual riders lead, primarily for leisure at recreational hotspots.  

4. **Bike Preferences**:  
   - Electric bikes are preferred by **78% of casual riders** and **77% of members** for their convenience and speed.  

5. **Revenue Insights**:  
   - Casual riders generate **higher revenue per ride**, particularly on electric bikes (~$9 per ride vs. $2 for members).
